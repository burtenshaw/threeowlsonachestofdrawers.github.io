# Exit, Unworking & Utopia. An Essay on Three Potential Methods of Resistance (2015) {#exit-unworking-utopia.-an-essay-on-three-potential-methods-of-resistance-2015 .entry-title}

::: {.entry-content}
[This text examines three possible forms of resistance in art and
politics: unworking, exit and utopia. It hints that all three modes to
resist are limited in their execution by a system where critique only
perpetuates that what it is trying to negate, and that a reconsideration
of how resistance can take form is a necessity in the present neoliberal
condition of art. Resistance as a rupture is insufficient; what else
could be considered to move beyond the linear scope between one extreme
and another? This could open up possibilities to create new criteria for
an alternative institutionality in both art and politics. [Exit,
Unworking & Utopia. An Essay on Three Potential Methods of
