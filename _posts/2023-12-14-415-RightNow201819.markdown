# Right Now (2018-19) {#right-now-2018-19 .entry-title}

::: {.entry-content}
The act of claiming has a dual connotation. Though it harks back to a
history of colonisation and theft, we could also consider the strike as
a form of claim, when people take back the rights they've been deprived
of. Reclaiming provides a counterpart to closure and private ownership,
especially when carried out collectively and for all. The claim has
hypothetical, utopian and speculative qualities; it does not seek
permission. Using a playful take on the format of the symposium, *Right
Now* looks at the emancipatory possibilities of the act of claiming,
through perspectives of feminist speculative fiction and utopian
literature.
