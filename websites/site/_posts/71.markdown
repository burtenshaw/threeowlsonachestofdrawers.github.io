# The Limits of My Language (2015) {#the-limits-of-my-language-2015 .entry-title}

::: {.entry-content}
is a collaborative project with Julieta Aguinaco initiated by the
statement: One doesn't find a different paradigm, We make it. Performed
at 'Do the Right Thing', Dutch Art Institute, Arnhem.

--\
Marianna Maruyama writes about the work: In a joint presentation of
their collaborative work, \[they\] offer a performance making heavy use
of text fragments and passages from their own work and the work of
others, together with videos by Aguinaco. They consider the possibility
of friendship as a community, all the while dealing with questions of
language, withdrawal, naming, and positioning within the art world,
asking, in more ways than one, what can be named and known?\
She muses, "there is an abundance of art practices, spaces...Where is
the absence? Where is our desert?" Reading together at times and taking
turns at others, the two artists read parts of their non-linear text,
and set up the entire performance in the loose structure of a play in
three parts: A Head Without a World (dealing with the theory of exit); A
Headless World where Julieta Aguinaco reads the text "Almost No Memory"
by Lydia Davis; and A World Without a Head (focused on the attempt to
find a desert, a quest for an absence).\
In the third act, Aguinaco presented three of her videos, all of which
follow a similar pattern where the viewer trails behind the protagonist
of the film (the artist) who is walking in various settings: a market at
night, a cemetery and natural geysers in Bolivia. In the videos, the
artist-protagonist is naming everything she sees and points at in an
almost manic, high-speed manner; she seems to be talking as fast as she
can. "This is a shop it's open, this is a shop, it's closed, etc." The
naming goes on for a few minutes until the sound fades out, leaving only
the silent image. This gives the viewer the sense that the act of naming
could go on forever. In the last film, Aguinaco narrates her films in an
especially unenthusiastic and detached voice, "welcome to the Andes.
Welcome out...Welcome home. Where? We have to look elsewhere," tying
back to Demoen's questions related to exit theory and withdrawal. Both
artists' work asks the audience to question whether the attempt to name
things only show the limits of our perception and our knowledge, or
rather addresses more complex issues and questions related to belonging
to a community, and the set of relations described by being and knowing?
