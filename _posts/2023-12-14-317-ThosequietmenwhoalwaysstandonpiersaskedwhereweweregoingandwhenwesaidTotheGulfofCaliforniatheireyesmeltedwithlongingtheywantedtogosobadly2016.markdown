# Those quiet men who always stand on piers asked where we were going and when we said, "To the Gulf of California", their eyes melted with longing, they wanted to go so badly (2016) 

is a lecture-performance of a script written with Julieta Aguinaco
during a visit to the Sea of Cortez. This visit was a reiteration of a
trip writer John Steinbeck and marine biologist Ed Ricketts did in 1940,
covering the whole peninsula of Baja California to collect sea specimens
--- documented in the novel The Log From the Sea of Cortez. Ricketts
collected sea life almost randomly, while Steinbeck's novel presents the
trip as an adventure, far from the organized and specific methods we
attribute to science. In this haphazard approach we could recognize a
similar urge when thinking about art. Furthermore, like Steinbeck and
Ricketts, we too were uninvited visitors researching a landscape that
never asked for us. What is in it for the visited? Performed at Nixon
Art Space, Mexico City.
