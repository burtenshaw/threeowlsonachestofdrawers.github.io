# To claim not to know what's already been claimed known / Facing the earth. Facing information. Facing our lives (2017) 

::: {.entry-content}
is a project developed together with Julieta Aguinaco at ARCUS Project
Residency in Moriya, Japan. How can we represent a place, specifically
the Tonegawa, without colonising it? is the central question to our
research into the Tonegawa as an element of the larger Moriya area in
Japan. 'Why the Tonegawa'? one person may ask. 'Don't you have your own
rivers back home that are as boring or spectacular as the Tonegawa?'
This question is fair. The impetus of this project is not necessarily
our interest in the river. In a way, we employed the Tonegawa as a lever
to discuss the issues of a visitor going to a place where he/she is not
from, and consequently trying to represent that place.\
The lecture-performance uses material gathered about the Tonegawa from a
scientific, a social and a personal perspective, questioning whether
representation without colonisation is possible when it becomes part of
a larger process of collecting. This process is endless, hence, we
wanted the amount of voices and interpretations to continue to grow
during the Open Studios at ARCUS Project. After the performance, there
was an opportunity for the visitors to share their comments, critique,
knowledge and ideas about the Tonegawa. These remarks were incorporated
into the performance for the next day.
