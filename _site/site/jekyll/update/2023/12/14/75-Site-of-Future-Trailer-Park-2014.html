<h1 id="site-of-future-trailer-park-2014">Site of Future Trailer Park (2014)</h1>

<p>is collaboratively curated by Julieta Aguinaco, Ben Burtenshaw and
myself as an exchange on the <a href="http://dutchartinstitute.eu/page/4450/roaming-research-academy-welcome-to-econotopia-commons-of-the-contemporary">Welcome to
Econotopia</a>
project that was initiated at the Dutch Art Institute in 2013 – curated
by Renée Ridgway. The group traveled to Mexico and Marfa, Texas as a
close research of the relationship between the geo-political issues,
Donald Judd and the mirage. The exhibition shows a series of outcomes
made on site and after, as well as a publication. These re-articulations
are an attempt to relate the issues explored within Welcome to
Econotopia; now in the context of the land we stood on as a physical and
social space.</p>
