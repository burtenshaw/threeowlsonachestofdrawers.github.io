# I can believe we still have to protest this shit (current)

::: {.entry-content}
takes as a starting point 'Het Rode Boekje van de Vrouw(en)' or 'The
Little Red Book of Woman/Women', collectively written in 1972 on the
cusp of the first national women's day in Belgium. The last pages of the
book contain a list of claims such as equal pay for the same work,
reform of schoolbooks that promote stereotypes and the right to decide
independently about abortion. Many of these claims are
continuous demands today.
