# Theater (2008-2012) 


zie!duif is a collective of eight artists that developed from the master
in Theatre Studies at the University of Antwerp ('06-'07). Twenty-two
students made the performance 'Een Tipje van de Luier' during an
intensive workshop led by Frank Vercruyssen (tg STAN). This performance
won the first prize at the Student Theatre Festival in Groningen, The
Netherlands. Winning the prize required making a new work for the next
edition, so zie!duif kept on growing as a collective, though not in the
amount of people. We lost fourteen and continued with eight.\
Eight artists that see each other as equals, without the interference of
a director or moderator. Eight different roads searching for a
collective path, suffering under the complexity of communication. This
experience will always be central in the performances. zie!duif jumps
from witty anecdotes to serious discussions to honest narratives. From
one thing to something else, just like people talk.  Eight stories,
eight opinions, eight visions, eight outbursts, and in between the
lines, eight attempts to reach something essential through language. And
the viewer finds itself in the middle of all this, physically and
mentally.\

STOCKHOLM (2008)

![©KristienVerhoeyen](/uploads/2016/01/stockholm-1024x409.jpg)


We are alone. Alone existentially. Professionals in the material of
being alone. It's just that we can't be without others. Do you
understand? That's why I'm here. Here, one finds understanding, a moment
of peace. It's not easy, you know, to sit together and listen to each
other. Actual listening. There is too much pointless chatter. I'm so
happy to be here. And it does help. We are here now. Here we are.

S: *In fact, we should all try to first understand each other, before we
aspire to be understood. Right?*\
R: *Yes, without any judgment or prejudice. *\
S: *And only when one can say "I understand you" to the one that has
just told her story...*\
R: *Sincerely understand*\
S:*... only then you can talk about your own problem and then this one
can say "I understand you too." And that's how you get to a mutual
understanding. Do you understand?*\
K: *Yes, we understand.*

ACTIE TEDDY (2009)

![©BartGrietens](/uploads/2016/01/actie-teddy-1024x681.jpg)

Its high time to make a decision. Within two weeks it will happen.
Within two weeks he has to be present, our guy, our leader and the face
of this action. Our guy will be a sign on the wall. A sign that time is
running out, that we slept too long. We cannot hide any longer. The
street is calling, the world is calling, the time is calling --
unfortunately all too often into the desert. We are almost petrified, as
is the ground beneath our feet, in which we dig for the roots of our
engagement. A heavy burden lies on the shoulders of our guy. He will be
the product of this action, entirely in accordance with the laws of our
time. The glitzy product, the tinkling name, the flashy logo. When the
time comes we should be able to sell our guy. When the time comes. In
two weeks. Time is running out.

19 JUNI (2010)

![©ClaraHermans](/uploads/2016/01/19juni_29-1024x680.jpg)

This is a just a normal choir. With sopranos, mezzo sopranos and altos.
Every week they come together to sing. Musical scales and complex
polyphonic music. A soprano makes coffee. An alto is looking at her.
Does she want coffee too? Another soprano takes her scores. What song
will she pick for the warming up? The alto is going to the toilet. Does
she have to go now? Why is she here? Where would she rather be if she
wasn't here? The soprano puts her scores down. Why do they do what they
do?

*Today, I experienced something I hope to understand in a few days.*
