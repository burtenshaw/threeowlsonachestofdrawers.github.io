<p>Carel Willink, a Dutch magical-realist painter, wrote an essay in 1950
on the subject that painting found itself in a critical moment. In the
text, he fulminates against modern, abstract art and criticizes
abstract-expressionists for not having any traditional métier or
expertise. In 1986, the unknown realist painter Gerard Jan van Bladeren,
who had read the essay by Willink, felt that something had to be done,
an act of resistance to wake up the art world. He walked into the
Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and attacked the abstract painting Who’s
afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue, by Barnett Newman. With a Stanley knife
he cut four horizontal and four vertical slits in the canvas. For the
restoration, the piece was send to an American firm called Goldreyer.
After four years, it appeared not restored but fully repainted with
three layers of opaque alkyd – a type of paint used mostly for window
frames. And not with linseed oil and a brush, but with a paint roller.
The director of the Stedelijk Museum called the painting handicapped,
and all resulted in a long court case until the expenses became too
high, and the city of Amsterdam had to give it up. A settlement was
created, and Amsterdam was not allowed to be critical about the
restoration any longer. In 2010, the story was brought up again. The
final conclusion was that the new layer of paint did differ from the
original one and also that Goldreyer had painted two layers of varnish
on top of the red paint, again with a paint roller. When van Bladeren,
the cutter, is released from prison, he is still obsessed with Who’s
Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue. He believed he had created a masterpiece
through destroying it and after hearing of the restoration, wants to
reinstall his work. In 1997, he returns to the Stedelijk, but the
painting is nowhere to be found. However, he notices Cathedra, another
work by Newman, and attacks this one instead, again with a Stanley
knife. This time he creates three long horizontal and two short vertical
incisions. Destroyed abstraction is the best art there is, he believes.
Afterwards, not only the instigator was accused, but the victim –
modern art – as well. The action was interpreted as an artistic
critique on museums that were reactionary for still installing this type
of paintings. There were speculations that the value of the painting
would even increase because of the damage done. ‘It is a turning point
in the history of modern art’, so it was declared, ‘it should remain on
the wall in its current state of
destruction’.]{style=”line-height: 1.6471;”}</p>

<p><strong>Who’s afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue</strong></p>

<p>Lunacharsky said in 1920: ‘I could sketch only with a couple of strokes
the peculiar zigzag line of the relationship between revolution and art
that we have hitherto observed. It has not been broken off. It continues
even further.’ (Revolution and Art). The bizarre story of Who’s afraid
of Red, Yellow and Blue, is one of many, but this one is peculiar. The
destruction was received as a political act of resistance with an
artistic meaning, but it could’ve also been an artistic act of
resistance with a political meaning – seeing that both parties were
found guilty, the museum because of its curatorial decisions, and the
cutter for obvious reasons. In Chantal Mouffe’s agonistic model of
democratic politics the divide between art and politics doesn’t exist.
The aesthetic strategies of the counter culture are exploited by
neoliberalism. Artistic critique is an important element of capitalist
productivity, even though any critique is neutralized by capitalism.
Mouffe doesn’t make a distinction between the political and the
artistic, but sees an aesthetic dimension in the political and a
political dimension in art. The core vibrant of democracy is the
agonistic struggle between different hegemonic projects. It can’t be
rationally resolved, for it defines the configuration of power relations
around which a given society is structured. The agonistic model allows
for possible transformation, and the public space is the arena where a
confrontation between different hegemonic projects takes place, without
any possibility of reconciliation. Critical art inspires dissent, and
therefore represents an important dimension of democratic politics. It
makes visible what the dominant consensus tries to obscure. Artistic
activism is when an artistic practice tries to give a voice to all those
who are silenced within the framework of the existing hegemony. However,
Mouffe does not believe that artistic activism could, on its own, bring
about the end of neo-liberal hegemony. It has to be linked to the
political fundaments of society. ’What is needed, therefore,’ Gerald
Raunig notes ‘are practices that conduct radical social criticism, yet
which do not fancy themselves in an imagined distance to institutions;
at the same time, practices that are self-critical and yet do not cling
to their own involvement, their complicity, their imprisoned existence
in the art field, their fixation on institutions and the institution,
their own being-institution.’</p>

<p><strong>Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf</strong></p>

<p>The first one of the following texts is by the Dutch playwright
Gerardjan Rijnders, it is the summary of one of his plays called
Liefhebber, freely translated into Lover. The second text is an extract
from Philip Roth’s The Humbling.</p>

<p>1 The theater critic, called Lover, comes home after another highly
disappointing performance. He has decided to never go to the theater
ever again, to not write any reviews any longer, no Ibsen, no Brecht and
no Shakespeare. He’d rather go to China, Chili, Bali and Mongolia. He’d
rather have cancer; he’d rather be death. But never will he ever see
another show. He blames the theater for not having any relation with
real life drama, there is drama everywhere, except on stage. He starts
ranting about the contemporary theater-theater. The so-called
art-theater, that has nothing to do with reality. He sees himself as a
socially engaged being, a little sentimental even. But not even him the
theater can thrill. While continually furious about a reality that he
compiles out of newspapers, radio and television reports, Lover does not
see the real life drama that is happening in his own living room. His
son Peter drinks from a vase, eats the flowers, burps, farts,
masturbates, takes a heroine shot, smashes the television and the radio,
fucks his mother, strangles his mother and kills himself. Lover does not
react to any of this, and has decided to call the editor to resign.
Whether he actually does that is left open.</p>

<p>2 He’d lost his magic. The impulse was spent. He’d never failed in the
theater, everything he had done had been strong and successful, and then
the terrible thing happened: he couldn’t act. Going on stage became
agony. Instead of the certainty that he was going to be wonderful, he
knew he was going to fail. It happened three times in a row, and by the
last time nobody was interested, nobody came. He couldn’t get over to
the audience. His talent was dead. All that had worked to make him
himself now worked to make him look like a lunatic. He was conscious of
every moment he was on the stage in the worst possible way. In the past
when he was acting he wasn’t thinking about anything. What he did well
he did out of instinct. Now he was thinking about everything, and
everything spontaneous and vital was killed – he tried to control it
with thinking and instead he destroyed it. It didn’t pass. He couldn’t
act. The ways he could once rivet attention on the stage! And now he
dreaded every performance, and dreaded it all day long. He spent the
entire day thinking thoughts he’d never thought before a performance in
his life: I won’t make it, I won’t be able to do it, I’m playing the
wrong roles, I’m overreaching, I’m faking, I have no idea even of how to
do the first line. He would hear the cue coming closer and closer and
know that he couldn’t do it. He waited for the freedom to begin and the
moment to become real, he waited to forget who he was and to become the
person doing it, but instead he was standing there, completely empty,
doing the kind of acting you do when you don’t know what you are doing.
He could not give and he could not withhold; he had no fluidity and he
had no reserve. Acting became a night-after-night exercise in trying to
get away with something.</p>

<p>Both anecdotes play with the notion of the defeat and the retreat. Lover
could be seen as the one who retreats because of a lack of reality.
Whereas the actor is defeated by reality; awareness makes him incapable
to act. However, these notions are not fixed. The retreater retreats
because he is defeated by what he had such high hopes for, in this case
the theater. What happens in the background is of no importance for his
defeat. The defeated actor as a result retreats fully from acting, and
as the story unravels, ultimately kills himself.<br />
The retreat is often mistaken for a passive act of self-alienation, just
look at all the strategies – disengagement, boycotts, not-working,
un-working, un-authoring; via exit strategies, through withdrawing,
functioning in the margins etc. But it does not necessarily include
abandonment of the political and the social, nor an escape from cultural
blind alleys. The retreat could be an act of resistance. According to
the supporting text of the program The Retreat at Documenta 13, it holds
the possibility to be a ground for politics and the politics of
aesthetics, since the process of production at the center of the social
owes its potential to the act of refusal. Politics and art are triggered
by a force that always starts from a choice – choosing to do or not to
do. However, how far can one retreat before falling of the edge? How
many loopholes can one find until the resources run out? How far can one
stretch the retreat until it becomes defeat?</p>

GEORGE: We all peel labels, sweetie; and when you get through the skin,
all three layers, through the muscle, slosh aside the organs and get
down to bone…you know what you do then?<br />
HONEY: <em>(Terribly interested)</em> No!<br />

There’s something inside the bone…the marrow…and that’s what you
